            <p>
              Zachary Israel Braff (born April 6, 1975) is an American actor, director, comedian, screenwriter, and producer. He is best known for his role as J. D. on the television series Scrubs (2001â€“2010), for which he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in 2005.</p>
            <p>
In 2004, Braff made his directorial debut with Garden State. He returned to his home state New Jersey to shoot the film, which was produced for $2.5 million. The film made over $35 million at the box office and was praised by critics, leading it to gain a cult following. Braff wrote the film, starred in it, and compiled the soundtrack album. He won numerous awards for his directing work, and also won the Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Album in 2005. Braff directed his second film, Wish I Was Here (2014), which he partially funded with a Kickstarter campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
Braff has also appeared on stage; All New People, which he wrote and starred in, premiered in New York City in 2011 before playing in London's West End, and he played the lead role in a musical adaptation of Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway in 2014.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text-center">Personal life</h2>
          <p>Braff's father Harold is a New Jersey attorney and among the founders of the state's American Inns of Court (AIC) and an elected trustee of the National Inns of Court Foundation. He has been widely recognized for furthering standards of excellence in the practice of law. Together with Braff's stepmother, marriage and family therapist Elaine Braff, he also teaches marriage and relationship education classes.</o>
          <p>

His brother Joshua Braff is an author, his other brother Adam Braff is a writer and producer and his stepsister, Jessica Kirson, is a New York-based comedian.</p>
          <p>

            In November 2008, Braff earned his pilot's license flying a Cirrus SR20.</p>
          <p>
In Episode 4.3 of the MTV show Punk'd, which aired on March 20, 2005, Braff was filmed yelling at a 12-year-old actor. He unwittingly appeared on the show at the behest of his Scrubs co-star Donald Faison, who pranked Braff by having the 12-year-old spray-paint Braff's new Porsche with fake paint. Braff pursued and caught the 12-year-old actor and punched him in the stomach; this was edited out of the episode.</p>
